# Agent Workflow Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a reconceptualized workflow architecture for question answering systems. The architecture consists of three distinct phases, each managed by a specialized agent:

1. **Question Development**
2. **Knowledge Base Development**
3. **Answer Generation**

This approach creates a pipeline where each phase builds upon the previous one, resulting in high-quality answers based on well-formulated questions and comprehensive knowledge bases.

## Workflow Process

The overall process follows this sequence:

```
newQuestion → QuestionDevelopmentAgent → improvedQuestion → KBDevelopmentAgent → knowledgeBase → AnswerDevelopmentAgent → finalAnswer
```

Where:
- `newQuestion` is the initial user query
- `improvedQuestion` is a refined, clarified version of the query
- `knowledgeBase` is a structured collection of relevant information
- `finalAnswer` is the comprehensive response to the original query

## Agent Descriptions

### 1. Question Development Agent

The Question Development Agent transforms an initial query into a well-structured, comprehensive question that captures the user's intent and provides sufficient context for effective knowledge retrieval.

#### Question Development Loop:

a. **Improvement Phase**: Use LLM to analyze and improve the question by:
   - Clarifying ambiguous terms
   - Expanding abbreviated concepts
   - Adding relevant context
   - Identifying implicit assumptions
   - Reformulating for precision

b. **Evaluation Phase**: Use LLM to evaluate the improved question based on:
   - Clarity and specificity
   - Completeness of context
   - Answerable scope
   - Alignment with original intent

c. **Decision Phase**: Based on evaluation results:
   - If evaluation indicates issues, iterate on the question (return to step a)
   - If evaluation is positive, accept the current version and proceed to Knowledge Base Development

### 2. Knowledge Base Development Agent

The Knowledge Base Development Agent builds a comprehensive knowledge base tailored to the improved question, gathering and organizing all information necessary to provide a complete answer.

#### Knowledge Base Development Loop:

a. **Planning Phase**: Use LLM to create a structured framework for the knowledge base:
   - Identify required supporting data points
   - Create a checklist of necessary information categories
   - Outline the structure of the knowledge base

b. **Query Generation Phase**: Use LLM to formulate effective search queries:
   - Generate diverse queries to cover different aspects of the question
   - Prioritize queries based on information importance
   - Adapt query formulation based on previous search results

c. **Information Extraction Phase**: Use LLM to analyze search results and extract relevant data points:
   - Identify and extract key information
   - Maintain source attribution for each data point
   - Assess reliability and relevance of information
   - Store mapping from sources to the points they support

d. **Knowledge Base Update Phase**: Use LLM to integrate new information:
   - Apply extracted data points to current version of knowledge base
   - Resolve contradictions between information sources
   - Identify and fill remaining information gaps

e. **Evaluation Phase**: Use LLM to assess knowledge base completeness:
   - Evaluate coverage of all required information
   - Identify remaining gaps or uncertainties
   - Decide whether to generate more searches (return to step b) or accept the current knowledge base and proceed to Answer Generation

### 3. Answer Development Agent

The Answer Development Agent synthesizes the improved question and knowledge base into a comprehensive, accurate, and coherent final answer.

#### Answer Development Loop:

a. **Answer Planning Phase**: Use LLM to create an outline for the answer:
   - Identify key components to address
   - Structure the response logically
   - Prioritize information based on relevance

b. **Draft Generation Phase**: Use LLM to create an initial answer draft:
   - Incorporate relevant information from the knowledge base
   - Maintain appropriate level of detail
   - Ensure all aspects of the question are addressed

c. **Evaluation Phase**: Use LLM to assess answer quality:
   - Accuracy and factual correctness
   - Completeness in addressing the question
   - Clarity and coherence
   - Appropriate citation of sources

d. **Refinement Phase**: Based on evaluation:
   - Address identified issues
   - Enhance clarity or completeness
   - Iterate until the answer meets quality standards

e. **Finalization Phase**: Format and present the final answer with:
   - Clear structure
   - Appropriate citations
   - Confidence indicators where applicable

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Agent Communication**: Each agent should pass structured outputs to the next agent in the pipeline, including metadata about confidence levels and potential limitations.

2. **Workflow Variables**: The system should maintain state through workflow variables that track:
   - Original and improved questions
   - Knowledge base components and their sources
   - Evaluation metrics at each stage
   - Iteration counts and decision points

3. **Tool Integration**: Each agent will primarily utilize:
   - LLM tools for generation, analysis, and evaluation
   - Search/retrieval tools for knowledge gathering
   - Evaluation tools to guide the iterative process

4. **Evaluation Conditions**: Clear evaluation criteria should be established for each phase to determine when to iterate versus when to proceed to the next phase.

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: The system should include graceful degradation paths when ideal information cannot be obtained or when questions cannot be fully improved.

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Improved Question Quality**: Dedicated focus on question improvement leads to more precise and answerable queries.

2. **Comprehensive Knowledge Gathering**: Structured approach to knowledge base development ensures thorough information collection.

3. **Transparent Answer Generation**: Clear lineage from question to knowledge to answer enables explanation and verification.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Each phase includes evaluation and refinement loops to ensure quality.

5. **Modular Design**: Each agent can be independently improved or replaced without affecting the overall architecture.
