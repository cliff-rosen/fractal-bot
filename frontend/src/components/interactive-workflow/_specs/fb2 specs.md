Orchestrator Platform
Product Specification for Proof of Concept

1. Executive Summary
Orchestrator is a platform for composing, running, and managing AI-powered knowledge workflows. It occupies the "Goldilocks zone" between black-box AI agents and low-level workflow programming—offering clarity, flexibility, and power without excessive complexity.
The platform enables users to:
Define goals and intent
Discover or create optimal workflows
Compose sequences of AI tools
Execute workflows
Inspect, modify, and improve results
Save and reuse successful workflows
This specification outlines the core functionality and user experience required for a proof of concept implementation.

2. Core Concepts
2.1 Journey
A structured, goal-driven collaboration between the user and the system's AI copilot. A journey starts with a user intention and ends with a deliverable.
Example: "Summarize client feedback on new pricing model."
2.2 Deliverable
The desired outcome or output of a journey. This can be a summary, draft, report, structured dataset, visual, decision, or action plan.
Example: "A slide with 3–5 summarized insights."
2.3 Workflow
The sequence of actions (steps) required to produce the deliverable. Can be dynamically generated, suggested by the copilot, or created manually.
Example: "Search Emails → Extract Feedback → Cluster Themes → Draft Slide"
2.4 Step
A discrete unit of work in a workflow. Each step uses a tool or agent, produces a result, and may update the asset space.
Example: "Run Email Search agent for 'pricing' threads"
2.5 Copilot
An AI assistant embedded in the journey. Converses with the user, proposes workflows, suggests tools, runs agents, and reflects on results.
2.6 Agent
A callable, intelligent actor that performs a task using tools, data, and rules. Agents can be reused across journeys and steps.
Example: EmailSearchAgent, FeedbackExtractorAgent
2.7 Tool
A function, template, or service that performs a specific operation. Tools are typically stateless and can be invoked directly or wrapped by agents.
Example: Prompt template, document chunker, vector search
2.8 Asset
Any intermediate or final output relevant to the journey. Shared among user, copilot, tools, and agents.
Example: A list of extracted feedback, a JSON file, a PDF, a saved prompt
